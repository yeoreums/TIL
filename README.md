# TIL (Today I Learned)

A collection of things I learn and fix every day while studying data engineering, Python, Linux, Airflow, and web development.

This repo helps me track my progress, organize solutions to debugging issues, and document concepts in my own words.
> Inspired by [@drecali](https://github.com/drecali)'s [TIL repo](https://github.com/drecali/til) and his advice to document even small learnings early on.
